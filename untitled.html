<div>Preventative approaches for cardiovascular disease have had&nbsp; a profound effect on reducing adult morbidity and mortality in the 20th&nbsp; century. Despite this, cardiovascular disease will remain one of the most&nbsp; important health challenges in the 21st century. Prolonged exposure&nbsp; to lifestyle and other types of risk factors make meaningful change in disease&nbsp; risk difficult to achieve as adults, particularly after the successes in&nbsp; cardiovascular mortality reduction since the 1970’s. New goals such as the World Heart Federation’s ‘25 by 25’&nbsp; campaign[1] or the American Heart&nbsp; Association’s 2020 Impact Goal[2] &nbsp;represent a fundamental shift in global emphasis to primordial prevention and supporting the attainment of ideal health rather than treatment of disease risk.</div><div>Atherosclerosis, the main pathological mechanism in&nbsp; cardiovascular disease, begins early in life. Compelling evidence for this already&nbsp; exists in autopsy and imaging studies. It is also clear that exposure to risk&nbsp; factors and behaviours such as dietary habits start in childhood and&nbsp; adolescence, setting individuals on differing health trajectories later in life.</div><div>An understanding of early life risk factors, and their&nbsp; immediate effects on atherosclerosis, provides insights into the natural origins&nbsp; of cardiovascular disease and the potential effectiveness and appropriate timing&nbsp; of interventions. Should the life-course model of health and disease prove&nbsp; informative, earlier intervention, during periods of childhood plasticity, will&nbsp; have lasting effects later in life. To realise these insights, investigation of&nbsp; traditional and novel risk factors, and their relation to cardiovascular health&nbsp; trajectories, is required.</div><h1 data-label="903014" class="ltx_title_section">1.1 Research Plan</h1><div></div>
